# yclaw Style Guide

The concrete style rules for this repository.

## Core Principles

1. **Fail fast, fail loud.** No defensive coding: no fallbacks, shims, or
   backwards-compat layers, and no guards against impossible states. No sentinel
   values, no silent defaults. If unused, delete it. Crash on the unexpected.
2. **Make invalid states unrepresentable.** Branded/newtype primitives, immutable
   data structures, required fields over optionals.
3. **Minimal changes.** Stay within scope. Make the test pass, then stop. Improve
   only the code you touch.
4. **Match surrounding code.** Follow this guide first, then the file you're in,
   then the module. If surrounding code violates this guide, fix it.

No language is chosen yet, so the rules below stay language-agnostic. When a stack
lands, prepend language idioms to the Core Principles above (Good/Bad examples
each) and make the sections below concrete for that language — naming, module
organization, error handling, and idioms.

## Error Handling

Keep error-handling blocks minimal: only the operation that can fail belongs
inside. No catch-all handlers that swallow everything; use dedicated error types.
Read required configuration so a missing key fails at startup. No sentinel return
values; raise, or return a typed result.

## Code Organization

Order each module: imports, constants, type aliases, helpers, classes, then
functions. Constants sit immediately after imports, before any class or function.
Use the language's export-control mechanism instead of underscore/naming
conventions to hide internals.

## Comments & Docstrings

Code documents itself through names, types, and organization. No comments except
TODOs, non-obvious workarounds, or disabled code. Document the public API only;
a doc comment that restates the signature is clutter to delete.

## Testing

Write strict assertions against specific expected values; a test that can't fail
uncovers nothing. Mock the boundaries your code talks to, such as the network,
filesystem, and clock, and leave the function under test real. A database (or any
stateful service) is not a mock boundary: when a test needs one, start a real
ephemeral instance with testcontainers rather than mocking the driver or using an
in-memory fake. Parameterize repeated test bodies, giving each case a descriptive
id and its own expected values.
